# 1MW Commercial Solar PV Optimization Project ☀️

### Project Overview
**Role:** Lead Designer & Techno-Economic Analyst
**Tools:** HelioScope, Excel (Advanced Financial Modeling), AutoCAD
**Location:** Bogotá, Colombia (Logistics Center Context)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary
This project involved the end-to-end design and feasibility analysis of a **792 kWp** commercial rooftop solar system for a logistics center.

The goal was to maximize energy production while minimizing structural impact and ensuring financial viability. By optimizing the string configuration and inverter layout, I reduced electrical complexity by **70%** compared to the initial automated design.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights
* **System Size:** 792 kWp (DC)
* **Annual Production:** 1.22 GWh
* **Shading Efficiency:** <1% loss (Achieved through precise exclusion zones for HVAC and skylights).
* **Hardware Optimization:** Reduced inverter count from **27 to 7** units, significantly lowering O&M costs and cabling requirements.

## 📊 Project Financial & Techno-Economic Analysis

### 1. Executive Summary
The financial modeling for the 792 kWp solar array confirms a robust investment opportunity. The project clears its CAPEX debt by **Year 4**, transitioning into a pure profit generator for the remaining 21 years of its lifecycle. The analysis below breaks down value creation across key milestones.

### 2. Lifecycle Performance (5-Year Intervals)
I segmented the project analysis to highlight the accelerating returns:

* **Phase 1: Recovery (Years 0-5)**
    * *Status:* **Break-even Achieved.**
    * By Year 5, the project has not only paid back the initial **$3.0 Billion COP** investment but generated a **72% ROI** (approx. $2.1B COP in net profit). This rapid liquidity recovery minimizes long-term financial risk.

* **Phase 2: Acceleration (Years 10-15)**
    * *Status:* **High Growth.**
    * As energy tariffs inflate (modeled at 5%) and the system requires minimal O&M, the cumulative savings compound significantly. By Year 15, the project reaches a **457% ROI**, providing nearly **$16.7 Billion COP** in free cash flow.

* **Phase 3: Long-Tail Value (Year 25)**
    * *Status:* **Maximum Yield.**
    * At the end of the warrantied life, the system delivers a Total Lifetime Saving of **$39.4 Billion COP**. This represents a massive **12x multiplier** on the initial capital invested.

### 3. Strategic Recommendation
Given the **4-year payback** and the positive cash flow starting early in Year 5, this project is self-funding relative to typical 5-7 year corporate financing structures. It is a 'Go' decision.
